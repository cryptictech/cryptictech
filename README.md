# Hello, I'm David Green (cryptictech) 🤓

### Who Am I?

I'm a family man who uses software engineering build practical systems for diverse needs. I host and manage open source and commercial solutions when available but build custom solutions where needed. I believe in self hosted systems and end user data ownership, but I'm realistic enough to know that sometimes that's not feasible or cost effective for every need. I believe AI is going to be a chaotic neutral revolution in our technology stack, and although there's risks in unmonitored self driven systems and misuse, AI is a great tool for augmenting development, education, design, and content generation. I'm striving to always learn something new.
